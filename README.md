To visualise the data, please select from the various headings of <b>Poverty, Age, Household Income, 
Obesity, Smokers, and Without Healthcare.</b> Each selection shifts the State data represented in circles on  
the graph. The small circles can then be selected or hovered over to view the specific values for that state.</p>

When selecting poverty and absence of healthcare one can find two extremes.  <b>Texas,</b> at the top of the graph, 
has a poverty rate of <b>17.2%</b> with <b>24.9%</b> of the population living without healthcare, and <b>Massachusetts</b> 
having a poverty rate of <b>11.6%</b>, yet only a <b>4%</b> rate without healthcare. 
            
For additional background, in <b>2006</b> a healthcare refrom was passed in <b>Massachusetts</b> with the aim to provide coverage to <b>100%</b> of it's residents. Conversely, it would be interesting to calculate the poverty level in Massachusetts <b>prior</b> to 2006 
to identify whether this coverage improved the state's rate of poverty.
            
Additionally, even in 2019, <b>Texas,</b> with one of the highest participating rates in Healthcare.gov (over 1 million), 
continues to experience a decrease in the participation each year, with the state taking legal action against the 
<b>Affordable Care Act (ACA).</b>

When shifting view and selecting <b>Age</b> instead of <b>Poverty</b>, one may note that the majority of those without 
healthcare are in the <b>35 - 45 age range.</b> However, one may also find when selecting <b>Obesity</b> and <b>Smokers</b>, the findings 
do not necessarily shift the average age range by a noticeable amount.
